        <p>Rabbits, scientifically known as Oryctolagus cuniculus, are small mammals belonging to the family Leporidae. Known for their soft fur, long ears, and powerful hind legs, rabbits are gentle creatures that can be found both in the wild and as domesticated pets. They are widely appreciated for their adorable appearance, playful nature, and calm demeanor.
            Rabbits are herbivores, feeding primarily on grasses, hay, leafy greens, and vegetables. Their digestive system is uniquely adapted to process fibrous plant material, and they are known to engage in a behavior called cecotrophy, where they re-ingest soft fecal pellets to extract additional nutrients. A diet rich in hay is essential for their dental and digestive health, as their teeth grow continuously and must be worn down by chewing.
            In the wild, rabbits are social animals that live in groups, often in underground burrows called warrens. These burrows provide protection from predators, such as foxes, hawks, and snakes. Rabbits are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk, when light conditions make them less visible to predators. They rely on their acute hearing, excellent vision, and speed to detect and escape threats.
            Domesticated rabbits come in various breeds, sizes, and colors, ranging from the small and compact Netherland Dwarf to the large and gentle Flemish Giant. As pets, rabbits are known for their affectionate and curious nature. They can form close bonds with their owners and enjoy interactive playtime. However, they are also delicate and require gentle handling to avoid stress or injury.
            Rabbits communicate through body language and subtle vocalizations. They thump their hind legs to signal danger, purr softly when content, and perform joyful jumps and spins known as "binkies" when they are happy. Despite their quiet nature, they are expressive animals that thrive on companionship and stimulation.
            Caring for a rabbit involves providing a safe, spacious environment where they can hop and explore. They need a secure enclosure or rabbit-proofed room, along with plenty of toys to chew and play with. Regular grooming is necessary for long-haired breeds, and all rabbits benefit from routine veterinary care to ensure their health.
            Rabbits have been associated with various cultural and symbolic meanings throughout history. In many cultures, they are seen as symbols of fertility, abundance, and good fortune. They have also become iconic figures in folklore and literature, such as the White Rabbit in Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland.
            Whether in the wild or as pets, rabbits are fascinating creatures that captivate with their charm, agility, and gentle temperament. For those who choose to care for them, rabbits offer a rewarding companionship that requires patience, dedication, and love.</p>
